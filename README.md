# 🧠 Student Management System in Python

This project is a beginner-friendly **Student Management System** built using **Python**. It's fully interactive and console-based, making it great for learning core programming concepts like:

✅ Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets  
✅ Loops, Conditionals, and Functions  
✅ Real-time user input handling  
✅ Data validation and updates  

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add new students with their grades and enrolled courses
- Update grades or courses for existing students
- Delete student entries
- Display all student details
- Retrieve a unique list of all courses offered

---

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

By building this project, I learned to:
- Use `.get()`, `split()`, `strip()`, and `map()` effectively
- Write clean `while` loops and nested conditionals
- Manipulate data stored in dictionaries and lists
- Handle errors and edge cases with user inputs

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Download the notebook: `model_2_projects.ipynb`  
2. Open in **Jupyter Notebook**, **VS Code**, or **Google Colab**  
3. Run each cell and interact with the console inputs

## 📸 Sneak Peek

Here's a preview of the student data structure:
```python
{
  "John": {
    "Grades": [85, 90, 78],
    "Courses": ("Math", "Science")
  }
}
